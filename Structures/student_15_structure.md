# My Structure - Student XX

## What I See in My Data
The numbers 1 to 4 in seperate rows (1 at the top 4 at the bottom) with the amount of that number in each row eg two 2s with the colour green.


## What I Think This Means
Build some green stairs that go up 4 steps.

## What This Could Be
Stairs

## Questions I Have
Any specific shade of green?
Does the width need to be a certain amount? /other dimensions of stairs.
